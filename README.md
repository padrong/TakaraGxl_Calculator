# TakaraGxl_Calculator
A calculator written in python 3 based off the takara GXL polymerase protocol. Used to calculate Tm. 

Python 3 required. Update 2.0 will introduce a gui and not be dependent on a command line installation of python3. 

To run, ./TakaraGxl_Calculator. Will prompt for F primer and R primer. Input them, case independent. 
Will return value of forward Tm and reverse Tm. Takara protocol dictates a standard temp for below or above a certain threshold. 
Only expected values of Tm will be 55 or 60.
